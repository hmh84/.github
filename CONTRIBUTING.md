1. Always communicate. Whether it is in the issue or the pull request, keeping the lines of communication helps everyone around you.

## Pull Requests

### _We actively welcome your pull requests, however linking your work to an existing issue is preferred._

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `beta` or DEFAULT branch if different.
1. Name your branch something that is descriptive to the work you are doing. i.e. adds-new-thing or fixes-mobile
1. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
1. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
1. If you make visual changes, screenshots are required.
1. Ensure the test suite passes.
1. Make sure you address any lint warnings.
1. If you make the existing code better, please let us know in your PR description.
1. A PR description and title are required. The title is required to begin with: "feat:" or "fix:"
1. [Link to an issue](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/autolinked-references-and-urls) in the project. Unsolicited code is welcomed, but an issue is required for announce your intentions. PR's without a linked issue will be marked invalid and closed.

### PR Validation
Examples for valid PR titles:

- fix: Correct typo.
- feat: Add support for Node 12.
- refactor!: Drop support for Node 6.

_Note that since PR titles only have a single line, you have to use the ! syntax for breaking changes._

### Work in progress
GitHub has support for draft pull requests, which will disable the merge button until the PR is marked as ready for merge.
